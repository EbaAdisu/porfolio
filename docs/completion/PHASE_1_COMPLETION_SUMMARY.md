## 🚨 Known Issues

### Build Error

-   **Issue:** Build fails due to special character `#` in folder path: `Personal\#\porfolio`
-   **Cause:** Windows path issue with Tailwind CSS 4 and special characters
-   **Impact:** Production build fails, but dev server works fine
-   **Solutions:**
    1. Rename folder to remove `#` character (e.g., `Personal\porfolio`)
    2. Or work around it by using the dev server for now

### Status

-   ✅ Dev server runs successfully
-   ✅ All animations work in development
-   ❌ Production build needs path fix
