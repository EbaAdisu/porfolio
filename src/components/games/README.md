## Adding a New Game

1. Create your game component (e.g., `TetrisGame.tsx`)
2. Add game animations using existing components
3. Register in `src/data/games.ts`
4. Update the games page to render your component

**Template:**

```tsx
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'
import AnimatedScoreCounter from '../animations/AnimatedScoreCounter'
import ElasticButton from '../animations/ElasticButton'
import GameLoadingAnimation from '../animations/GameLoadingAnimation'

export default function YourGame() {
    const [score, setScore] = useState(0)
    const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true)

    return (
        <>
            {isLoading && (
                <GameLoadingAnimation onComplete={() => setIsLoading(false)} />
            )}
            <div>
                <AnimatedScoreCounter score={score} />
                {/* Your game logic */}
            </div>
        </>
    )
}
```

## Game Animations

All games can use these animation components:

-   **AnimatedGameCard** - 3D floating card wrapper
-   **AnimatedScoreCounter** - Number counter with pop effect
-   **ConfettiAnimation** - Victory particle explosion
-   **GameLoadingAnimation** - Loading screen with shapes
-   **ElasticButton** - Bouncy button press effect

## Data Management

Games are registered in `src/data/games.ts`:

```typescript
export const games: Game[] = [
    {
        id: 'snake',
        title: 'Snake Game',
        description: '...',
        difficulty: 'Easy',
        players: 'Single Player',
        component: 'SnakeGame',
    },
    // Add more games here
]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Canvas** - For better performance with game graphics
2. **RequestAnimationFrame** - For smooth game loops
3. **Cleanup** - Always clean up intervals/RAF in useEffect
4. **Responsive** - Make games work on different screen sizes
5. **Accessibility** - Include keyboard controls and instructions
